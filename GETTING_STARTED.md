   - Sign in or create an account if you donâ€™t have one.
   - Generate a new API key to use the "deepseek/deepseek-r1:free" model used in this project.

3. **Set Up API Keys**:
   - Create/Open the `.env` file in the project's root directory.
   - Paste your generated API key in place of the placeholder `LLM_API_KEY`.

   the .env file should look like this 
   ```
    # .env file
    LLM_API_KEY="paste your API Key here"
   ```

2. Follow the on-screen instructions to:
   - Confirm detected ingredients.
   - Generate recipes based on your selected meal type.
